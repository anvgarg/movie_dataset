The outline of ML assignment  

Given the data set your task is to predict how much revenue a movie will make.

Target Column - revenue
Evaluation Criteria - Root-Mean-Squared-Logarithmic-Error (RMSLE)

A Python script or Jupyter notebook detailing the steps and approach.
Design your transformation/pipeline so that we can pass a test dataframe to get the prediction.

What we will be evaluating on.
(1) Structured thinking to solve this problem.
(2) Data handling and featurization technique(aligned to machine learning model).
(3) Generalization error.
(4) Your ideas and thoughts that you can apply given enough time.
